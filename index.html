        <p> <strong> About Six Feet Apart </strong> </p>

        <p> Six Feet Apart was created during Florida International University's (FIU) PantherHacks 2020 hackathon. The problem statement of the 
            hackathon was to develop a solution to a problem that has emerged due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. With that goal in mind, 
            Six Feet Apart aims to connect people virtually as physical contact is extemely limited due to social distancing guidelines. Watch the video below
            for more information on Six Feet Apart including why was created, how it works, and what tools were used to develop it.
